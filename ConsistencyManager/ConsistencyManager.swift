/**
 This is the main class for the library and contains most of the logic. For a detailed overview, please check the docs.

 ### Overview

 This class manages a list of listeners and ids (that identify the model that the listener is listening to).
 When you post an update to the consistency manager, it will regenerate new models for any applicable listener.
 It then notifies the listener of these changes.

 Given a model, any class can listen to updates on this model.
 Whenever anything in this model should change, the consistency manager will generate a new model
 and call the ConsistencyManagerListener delegate method with this new model.
 All models must adhere to the ConsistencyManagerModel protocol.

 ### API

 The two important APIs that you will mainly use in this class are:

 `listenForUpdates(listener: ConsistencyManagerListener)`
 `updateWithNewModel(model: ConsistencyManagerModel, context: Any? = nil)`

 These APIs allow you to start listening for updates on a model and register new updates.
 Anytime you change a model locally, you should call updateWithNewModel to propegate these changes.

 Additionally you have the following APIs to use if you choose to
 have your listener temporarily pause (and later resume) listening to updates:

 `pauseListeningForUpdates(listener: ConsistencyManagerListener)`
 `resumeListeningForUpdates(listener: ConsistencyManagerListener)`

 #### Removing Listeners

 In general, we recommend you don't remove listeners manually because it isn't necessary.
 The consistency manager does not hold strong references to any models or listeners.
 However, if you want to manually remove a listener, see `removeListener(listener: ConsistencyManagerListener)`
