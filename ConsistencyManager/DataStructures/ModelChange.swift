 This class is used to show which child models have changed. This object is usually in a dictionary: `[String: ModelChange]`.
 The strings represent IDs and it shows what's changed in this ID. Either the ID has been deleted or updated.
 If it's been updated, there are potentially several models that have updated if you are using projections.
 If you are not using projections, this will always have exactly one model.
